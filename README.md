# Shallowest-Spanning-Tree

Basically a function where it finds a spanning tree which minimises the number of edges from the root of the spanning tree (we can choose where the root is) to the deepest leaf. This function does not consider the weights on the edge (if it is given) of the graph stored in the Graph class.
